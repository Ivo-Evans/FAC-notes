# Django

Django is an opinionated web framework for Python. Unlike Express, it offers you a smaller number of ways to do things, and it is less obvious how the pieces fit together because they are more highly abstracted. On the flipside, though, a Django project offers some useful features right out of the box: excellent security and an admin site for managing your databases. Django databases are relational by default - noSQL databases are only supported unofficially. 

There seem to be quite a lot of jobs in Django. Nevertheless, I'm not sure it will survive for a long time. It seems to have been built very specifically for a monolithic, server-heavy structure. As we move towards cloud computing and microservices, it might become less appropriate, and its ecosystem might struggle to adapt it. Anyway that's just my sense.
