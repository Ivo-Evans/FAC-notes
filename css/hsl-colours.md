hsl colours are the recommended colour format at FAC, because they can be changed more intuitively than hex or RGB colours. They look like this:

  main {
    background-color: hsl(20, 10%, 0%)
  }

hsl stands for hue, saturation, lightness, and that's what these three numbers above are. Notice that hue, is an integer, and saturation and lightness are percentages.

Hue is the most basic variable, and represents a degree on a colour-wheel. It can be an integer from 0 to 360.

Saturation represents how close or far from grey the colour is. Some sad films still have colour, but it's barely visible because the saturation is very low, so they look very grey.

Finally, lightness is how close they are to black or white.


There are also hsla colours, where a represents opacity and stands for alpha. They look like this:

  main {
    background-color: hsla(20, 10%, 0%, 0.5)
  }
