display takes a lot of values, but we're going to talk about a few key ones:

- none
- block
- inline
- inline-block
- flex and grid


Certain elements default to certain display properties. For instance, p is block by default, a is inline by default and table elements are table by default.

## none

Firstly, you can make an element disappear from the flow of the page with display: none;


## block

A block-level element takes up the entire row (or if the page is rotated, as in Mongolian, column) and creates a newline after it. Good examples here are <p>, <section> and <main>, but you can also set this as a value for attributes if you want them to take up an entire line.

You can style the height and width of block-level elements. 

## inline

An inline element takes up only as much space as it needs, and you cannot adjust its width or height. A good example here are anchor links and span tags.


## inline-block

This is a compromise of the two above. An inline-block element does not take up the whole line, but can be styled for height and widht.

## flex and grid

display: flex; or display: grid; makes the element a flex container or a grid. This has serious ramifications for the children of the element, but what about the element itself?

flex containers and grids are _block-level elements_

There is also the

  display: inline-flex;

and

  display: inline-grid;

property.
